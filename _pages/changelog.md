# Changelog
Here you can view a changelog and version history for **WristCheck**. Got some suggestions for features youâ€™d like to see in a future update? Please feel free to mention in an app review via Apple or Google, drop me an email or @ me on Twitter _(or whatever it's called this week)!_

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.5.1**
In version 1.5 the main update is a change to the user interface of the main watch box view. The page now shows watch images (if you've added them!), adds various options to change the display order of the watches and lets you choose between the original list view, or a grid view with larger images.
It also makes access to search more prominent and makes it easier to switch between your various 'watch boxes' (e.g. your wishlist or sold watches)

#### What's New
- UI overhaul of the main watch box
- Watch images now show in watch box view
- Quicker access to search
- Choose the display order of your collection
- Choose a list or grid view for the UI
- Updates to software libraries and OS target levels

#### Bug Fixes
- Includes a fix to the original v1.5 which caused overlapping text on the grid view when on a smaller screened device.

### **Version 1.4.1**
This update focuses on making me rich... wait, sorry! It focuses on letting users remove ads from the app with a quick and simple in-app payment. I rely on the ad income to help me cover the development costs of the app (sadly it's not free!) but in this release have added a way to remove these, and allowed the user to pick the price they pay to do so.

#### What's New
- WristCheck Pro added!
- Remove Ads with an in-app purchase
- Pick chart default order options

#### Bug Fixes
-  Bug fix related to saving images with special characters in the watch name

<br>

### **Version 1.3**
I love looking at the back of some of my watches almost as much as I love looking at their dials! So in this update I've added the ability to capture a second picture for each watch - nobody is forcing you to use this for the case back of course, but that's why I put it in there!
The update also adds the ability to upload the watch images at the same time you add the watch record to the app, rather than having to go in and do it as a second action (which I'm sure you'll agree is an improvement!).
To improve the chart experience I've also included the ability to set defaults for the chart view (so you can have it always show the current year, current month, previous month or all time stats).
Lastly I've included logic that will prompt to leave a rating or review after a period of time using the app - please consider using this as ratings really help with app visibility!

#### What's New
- Caseback images - add a second photo to each watch
- Add images when creating new watch records
- Chart Preferences - set default filters and chart types
- Added 'review app' prompt

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Refactor of code for better image management
-  Auto Capialise Watch Names
-  Help text improvements for watch wear history view
-  Improved placement of image picker (Gallery/Camera) option

<br>

### **Version 1.2**
A relatively small release, v1.2 introduces small ads throughout the app - I've tried to keep these as unobtrusive as possible - most are small banner ads, with some pages with more whitespace showing slightly larger banners.

#### What's New
- Implemented unobtrusive banner ads throughout the app
- Added a button to save and share screenshots directly from the wear chart screeen

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Fixed permission prompt issue for Android notifications.


<br>

### **Version 1.1**
In the first major update to WristCheck a _'what's new'_ pop-up has been included, that displays whenever the app is updated to advise of any new features - and to make use of it this release also includes an option to backup and restore the app database, as well as introducing the option to setup a helpful daily reminder to track what watch you're wearing.

#### What's New
- Implemented a 'what's new' pop-up that shows when the app version updates
- Backup & Restore the watch database
- Set up daily wear reminders

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Reference number field added to watch model
