# Changelog
Here you can view a changelog and version history for **WristCheck**. Got some suggestions for features youâ€™d like to see in a future update? Please feel free to mention in an app review via Apple or Google, drop me an email or @ me on Twitter _(or whatever it's called this week)!_

<br>

### `Latest`
# **Version 1.9.0**
A relatively big update this time, with some nice new additions and the first 'WristCheck Pro' feature drops - to date all functionality has been free to everyone, and it's important to me that the app provides value to everyone (I didn't set out to make money, I set out to make an app for fellow watch nerds!) but I think the app has now reached the point where it's got a really solid set of core features (watch data tracking, wear tracking and charts, a visual representation of what you've worn via the calendar etc) so felt it was time to add a few wee extras for the extra nerdy amongst us!

But first up, I wanted to include some more features that improve the app experience for everyone...

First, the app logo has been added to the sidebar - I know this is a really minor update, but I think it really improves the whole sidebar! This goes hand in hand with some slight adjustments to add a new 'App Data' menu item, to bring together the existing Backup/Restore features and the new **CSV Extracts** option.

This allows you to export your data in two forms, either a simple list of each watch with all their data and a consolidated wear count (useful if you need a quick list for insurance purposes perhaps?) or a second more complex option, that has one line for every recorded wear (so multiple lines per watch) - perfect if you want to do your own data analysis!

Next up, I've also replaced the old date-list view with a calendar view, showing wear dates, servicing and warranty dates on a per-watch basis. From here you can quickly review, add and delete wear records for the chosen watch.

So, onto those 'WristCheck Pro' features - as mentioned, I don't do this to make money (I'm _not even close_ to the point I could claim to earn minimum wage from my wee apps!), but I did want to start adding some little extras for supporters, and wanted to focus on exactly that - **extras** - fun wee additions that just add a bit more value for the _real nerds_ among us!

First up - and something I've had a few requests for - the ability to set a second daily reminder. Quite a few people wear a work watch and then swap over in the evening, so now they can get reminded to log into the app twice a day to track what they're wearing.

Then, last but by no means least, I've added some per-watch graphs (currently accessed via a link from the watch page, but I'll add something to the 'stats' page in the next drop) - initially two options are available - a breakdown of wears by month, and another of wears by weekday. Not going to lie, I _love_ wee graphs so this is my favourite addition and works well! I'm planning to further refine these in future releases and will probably add more - as always please feel free to drop me a note with any ideas or suggestions.

#### What's New
- The WristCheck logo has been added in the sidebar menu, along with a slight menu re-design.
- The Calendar view is now extended to give calendar breakdowns for individual watches - quickly review, add or delete wear dates.
- CSV data extracts - generate simple (one line per watch) or complex (one line per wear record) CSV extracts, to quickly summarise your collection or to draw your own charts!
- (Pro) WristCheck Pro users can now set a second daily reminder.
- (Pro) New watch data charts are available to Pro users, showing a breakdown of wearing habits for individual watches, by weekday or by month.

# **Version 1.8.0**
When I first built WristCheck I was relatively new to watch collecting, having recently purchased my first mechanical watch... I was also clearly quite naive as I thought a schedule of when services were due would be a headline feature of the app! Instead, I got quite a bit of feedback that, whilst it's useful to know when servicing is due per manufacturers suggestions, many owners only get their watches serviced at the point where they notice a drop in accuracy.
I've also never been happy with the lack of visualisation of how your wear tracking is going, which was visible as a big list of dates per watch... so this fix hopefully addresses this with the addition of a new **Calendar View**.
From the main landing page, this replaces the third page tab, and populates a calendar quickly highlighting each day where a watch wear has been recorded, as well as showing upcoming service due dates (if tracked) and **warranty expiry dates.**
Speaking of which - you can now also add a warranty expiry date to your watches!

But what about the old servicing view? It wasn't useless, but definitely was a _secondary feature_ (i.e. not necessarily a primary use case for most) of the app and therefore rather than getting rid of it, I've simply moved it to a more appropriate place.
On the calendar view there's a small circular button that changes from a month/day calendar view to the old servicing view, however it's now been tidied up and includes tabs along the top to switch between a service schedule and a warranty end schedule.

With this release I think I'm now happy with the primary features of the app, so going forward the next few updates will all be about just making things _better_. As always, if you have any feedback please feel free to drop an email to [feedback@wristcheck.app](mailto:feedback@wristcheck.app) or write an app review on your favourite app store - user input genuinely does help me continue to improve the app!

#### What's New
- New Calendar view (replacing original Servicing schedule as a main tab), visualising all wear data.
- Ability to see a list of all watches worn on a selected date, as well as other scheduled events such as service due dates.
- Ability to add wear records directly to the calendar.
- New warranty expiry date field added to the Watch model.
- Updated Schedule view, allowing a user to view a chronological service due schedule or a warranty expiry schedule.
- Website link (www.wristcheck.app) added to the About App info, along with some smaller cosmetic updates here.

#### Bug Fixes
- Updated the calculation algorithm for the 'cost per wear' value - this now takes into account any returned value when a watch is sold.

# **Version 1.7.1**
Another self-contained, _big_ release, and one that I'm really proud of! When I built **WristCheck** I initially wanted to be able to use data to really _understand_ my collection and how I interacted with that. The _Wear Charts_ were the first manifestation of this, however they were quite basic, only showing individual watches with counts which could be filtered by a combination of month and year...
With version 1.7.1 though I've attempted to supercharge that! You can now see the charts over alternative time periods (such as last 30 or 90 days), have additional options to group the results (by watch, by manufacturer, by category or by movement type!) and you can filter the results to include or exclude sold and archived watches, or to only show specific movement types or watch categories!

#### What's New
- Update to Wear Chart screen to include new filter and grouping options.
- Group charts by watch, manufacturer, category or movement type.
- Filter chart by new time periods, by movement type or by category.
- Include or exclude Sold and Archived watches from the reports.

#### Bug Fixes
- The new implementation of the Wear Charts will extend past the bottom of the screen and become scrollable if there are a lot of records returned. This fixes an old bug where if you had ~30 watches being displayed, the names of every second chart line disappeared.
- In line with the above, the chart Screenshot functionality has been updated to automatically capture the full size of the chart and any current filter information when the button is pressed.

# **Version 1.6.4**
This release includes a few small improvements and bug fixes which didn't feel like they warranted a large version bump. Behind the scenes updates include implementation of improved crash logging and analytics to help me to make the app _better,_ as well as a new pre-order status to provide a countdown to a watches target release/delivery date.

#### What's New
- Updated notification code to work with the latest versions of Android and iOS.
- New Pre-Order status to allow a countdown to watch release.
- Option added to do a bulk export of all watch images, making it easier to move to a new device.
- Implemented Crashlytics logging and Firebase Analytics to help to quickly address performance issues and to better understand app usage to guide future updates.

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an old bug where the in-app version history wouldn't fully scroll to the bottom.
- Slight adjustment to notification code to keep the notification at the scheduled time during daylight savings time changes.

<br>

# **Version 1.6.1**
In version 1.6 I have focused on improving the add/view/edit watch user interface, to (hopefully) make it more intuitive to use, and easier to find the details you want quickly!

Additionally, this release includes new data points that you can save for each watch, including: category, movement type, and purchase and sale information (such as date, price and who the watch was bought from/sold to).

Of course more data also means more analysis, so the app can now also provide a 'cost per wear' value for each watch, charts showing the movement types and watch categories that make up your collection as well as calculations of collection spend amongst others.

#### What's New
- UI overhaul of the add/view/edit watch pages
- Capture more watch details such as category and movement types
- Capture watch value data such as purchase and sale dates, prices and who the watch was purchased from/sold to
- Additional information added to the collection stats section, including additional charts and data analysis

#### Bug Fixes
- The way database backup works has been changed to avoid a crash issue on iOS - now rather than the app attempting to write a copy of the database to a new location, it pushes a copy to the platforms 'share' function, allowing you to send the database copy wherever you like quickly (I'd recommend sending to iCloud/Google Drive or similar every so often!).

<br>
# **Version 1.5.1**
In version 1.5 the main update is a change to the user interface of the main watch box view. The page now shows watch images (if you've added them!), adds various options to change the display order of the watches and lets you choose between the original list view, or a grid view with larger images.
It also makes access to search more prominent and makes it easier to switch between your various 'watch boxes' (e.g. your wishlist or sold watches)

#### What's New
- UI overhaul of the main watch box
- Watch images now show in watch box view
- Quicker access to search
- Choose the display order of your collection
- Choose a list or grid view for the UI
- Updates to software libraries and OS target levels

#### Bug Fixes
- Includes a fix to the original v1.5 which caused overlapping text on the grid view when on a smaller screened device.

<br>

### **Version 1.4.1**
This update focuses on making me rich... wait, sorry! It focuses on letting users remove ads from the app with a quick and simple in-app payment. I rely on the ad income to help me cover the development costs of the app (sadly it's not free!) but in this release have added a way to remove these, and allowed the user to pick the price they pay to do so.

#### What's New
- WristCheck Pro added!
- Remove Ads with an in-app purchase
- Pick chart default order options

#### Bug Fixes
-  Bug fix related to saving images with special characters in the watch name

<br>

### **Version 1.3**
I love looking at the back of some of my watches almost as much as I love looking at their dials! So in this update I've added the ability to capture a second picture for each watch - nobody is forcing you to use this for the case back of course, but that's why I put it in there!
The update also adds the ability to upload the watch images at the same time you add the watch record to the app, rather than having to go in and do it as a second action (which I'm sure you'll agree is an improvement!).
To improve the chart experience I've also included the ability to set defaults for the chart view (so you can have it always show the current year, current month, previous month or all time stats).
Lastly I've included logic that will prompt to leave a rating or review after a period of time using the app - please consider using this as ratings really help with app visibility!

#### What's New
- Caseback images - add a second photo to each watch
- Add images when creating new watch records
- Chart Preferences - set default filters and chart types
- Added 'review app' prompt

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Refactor of code for better image management
-  Auto Capialise Watch Names
-  Help text improvements for watch wear history view
-  Improved placement of image picker (Gallery/Camera) option

<br>

### **Version 1.2**
A relatively small release, v1.2 introduces small ads throughout the app - I've tried to keep these as unobtrusive as possible - most are small banner ads, with some pages with more whitespace showing slightly larger banners.

#### What's New
- Implemented unobtrusive banner ads throughout the app
- Added a button to save and share screenshots directly from the wear chart screeen

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Fixed permission prompt issue for Android notifications.


<br>

### **Version 1.1**
In the first major update to WristCheck a _'what's new'_ pop-up has been included, that displays whenever the app is updated to advise of any new features - and to make use of it this release also includes an option to backup and restore the app database, as well as introducing the option to setup a helpful daily reminder to track what watch you're wearing.

#### What's New
- Implemented a 'what's new' pop-up that shows when the app version updates
- Backup & Restore the watch database
- Set up daily wear reminders

#### Bug Fixes and minor improvements
-  Reference number field added to watch model
